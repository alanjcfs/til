Introduction to Parser Combinators by James Coglan

It was difficult to go through the whole blog post and try to port if over to
Rust and there were some inconsistencies in his writing that with the help of an
editor would have been fixed.

One example most recently encountered was him refering the "root" without
explaining where the root came from. It would turn out that in the next blog
post, he would have in the Addition class defined `root` as being an alias of
`expression`.
