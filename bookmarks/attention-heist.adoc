Attention is our most precious commodity, but it is also the most ineluctable
because it is so easy for your attention to slip from one to another thing,
a rivulet of attention that cannot stop by continuously flow down.

My thoughts
-----------

Meditation may help. It may help more by trying to make you aware of
distractions and to allow you to let such distractions go. Being able to observe
from another self instead of being swept by these distractions to and fro.
