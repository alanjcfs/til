Iceberg Theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_Theory

Theory of Omission regarding the narrative of a story. Omitting something
important can make people "feel" more or glean more meaning from a story than
omitting because you don't know.

Zeigarnik Effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect

Leaving things uncompleted or interrupted allow people to remember them more
(apparently). For example, waiters had better recollections of unpaid orders,
but once paid, they don't remember them anymore. This could apply to programming
if you leave a task unfinished, so that the next day, you will be able to return
to it when possible.
