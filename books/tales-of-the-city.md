I didn't finish reading the book, but it was an interesting introduction to the
1970s San Francisco. It is like looking at a time capsule to see what life was
like before there was an internet. People created social days at grocery stores
for the purpose of cruising. They will literally ask about buying oranges as
a prelude to flirtation.

Mary Ann Singleton represented a woman not from San Francisco learning about the
city.

Anna Madrigal was a kindly woman who watches over everyone.

Michael Mouse Tolliver was a fabulous gay man who enjoys life.
