Kale, tomato, and lemon magic one-pot spaghetti

Estimated cooking time: 15 minutes

This pasta is a complete revelation. The sauce is magically made from the pasta
water and tomatoes as the pasta cooks---all in one pan. No fuss, one pan, and a
killer bowl of pasta.

Pasta and gluten sometiems get bad press. I think there is a time and place for
a good bowl of pasta. Saying that, I opt for interesting pastas as often as I do
the traditional kind. Try corn, chickpea, or buckwheat spaghetti.

You need a large shallow saute pan or casserole large enough to fit the pasta
lying down.

Serves 4 Generously

14 ounces/400 g spaghetti or linguine
14 ounces/400 g cherry tomatoes
zest of 2 large unwaxed lemons
7 tablespoons/100ml olive oil
2 heaping teaspoons flaky sea salt
1 (14 ounce/400-g) bunch of kale or spinach

Fill and boil a kettle of water.
Put the pasta into the pan. Chop the tomatoes in half and throw them into the
pan. Grate in the zest of both lemons and add the oil and salt.
Add about a quart/liter of boiling water. Put the lid on the pan and bring back
toa boil.
Remove the lid and simmer on high heat for 6 minutes, using a pair of tongs to
turn the pasta every 30 seconds or so as it cooks.
Remove any tough stalks from the kale or spinach and coarsely tear the leaves.
Once the pasta has had 6 minutes, add the kale and ocntinue to cook for a
further 2 minutes.

Once almost all the water has evaporated, take the pan off the heat and tangle
the pasta into four bowls. Top with a little Parmesan.
