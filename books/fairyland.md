## Fairyland

It was a very interesting book to read about how a daughter's father moved to
San Francisco and tried to create a life for both of them. He loved her enough
to take care of her, while also feeling frustrated with her because she probably
kept him from having more men over. He had a few things happening in his life
that she probably didn't know or she chose to ignore.
